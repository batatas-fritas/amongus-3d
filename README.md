# Among Us 3D

Among Us copy in 3D made with Unity.

## Setup
- **Unity Editor Version:** 2022.3.9f1 LTS
- Clone this repo
- Unity Hub -> Open -> repo folder
- Let unity build its dependencies

## Visual Studio (highly recommended)
- Pretty sure Unity asks if you want to install Visual Studio along with it
- If you don't have it already, [get it here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- On what to install make sure you get the unity package (don't really know if you need other ones)
